# ProHandel Lambda Integration: Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Lambda Function Deployment**:
   - Created IAM role and policy with necessary permissions
   - Deployed the Lambda function to AWS with proper configuration
   - Set up environment variables for API access

2. **Data Quality Monitoring**:
   - Created a data quality monitoring script (`data_quality_monitor.py`)
   - Defined configuration for data quality checks (`data_quality_config.json`)
   - Implemented checks for record counts, null values, duplicates, referential integrity, and data freshness

3. **dbt Project Setup**:
   - Created a dbt project structure for data transformation
   - Implemented staging models for raw data transformation
   - Created intermediate models with business logic
   - Built mart models for specific use cases (inventory insights, sales performance)
   - Added data quality tests in the dbt models

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Fivetran Connector

Follow the instructions in `/lambda_connector/FIVETRAN_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` to:
- Create a new AWS Lambda connector in Fivetran
- Configure the connector with the Lambda function ARN
- Set up the necessary secrets
- Test the connection
- Configure the schema and destination

### 2. Monitor Initial Sync

- Check CloudWatch logs for Lambda function execution
- Monitor the sync status in Fivetran
- Verify data is being loaded correctly into your destination database

### 3. Run Data Quality Checks

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run data quality checks
python data_quality_monitor.py --config data_quality_config.json --output data_quality_report.md
```

### 4. Run dbt Models

```bash
# Navigate to dbt project directory
cd dbt_prohandel

# Install dbt dependencies
dbt deps

# Run dbt models
dbt run

# Run dbt tests
dbt test
```

### 5. Implement Dashboards

Create dashboards for:
- Inventory Overview
- Stock Level Monitoring
- Sales Performance
- Demand Forecasting

### 6. Set Up Monitoring and Alerts

- Configure CloudWatch alarms for Lambda errors
- Set up alerts for data quality issues
- Monitor dbt job execution
