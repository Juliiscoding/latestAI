# Snowflake ROI Optimization Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation Steps

### 1. Environment Assessment
- Verified existing warehouses: COMPUTE_WH, MERCURIOS_LOADING_WH, MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_WH, MERCURIOS_DEV_WH
- Confirmed database and schema structure: MERCURIOS_DATA with RAW, ANALYTICS, and ADMIN schemas
- Identified available tables in RAW schema for analytics views

### 2. Schema Setup
- Confirmed ANALYTICS schema exists for analytics views
- Confirmed ADMIN schema exists for administrative functions and cost monitoring

### 3. Analytics Views
- Created DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY view for daily sales metrics
- Created CUSTOMER_INSIGHTS view for customer analysis
- Created PRODUCT_PERFORMANCE view for product metrics

### 4. Dashboard Infrastructure
- Created MERCURIOS_TASK_WH for scheduled tasks
- Created refresh tasks for materialized views
- Set up task scheduling for optimal resource usage

### 5. Cost Monitoring
- Created DAILY_COST_SUMMARY view for tracking daily Snowflake costs
- Created DAILY_COST_SUMMARY_TABLE for persistent cost metrics

## Next Steps for Complete ROI Optimization

### 1. Fix Permission Issues
Some views could not be created due to permission issues. To resolve:
```sql
-- Grant necessary permissions to your user
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE MERCURIOS_DATA TO ROLE MERCURIOS_DEVELOPER;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA MERCURIOS_DATA.RAW TO ROLE MERCURIOS_DEVELOPER;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA MERCURIOS_DATA.RAW TO ROLE MERCURIOS_DEVELOPER;
```

### 2. Complete Analytics Views
The following views had errors and should be fixed:
- INVENTORY_STATUS view (permission issues with INVENTORY table)
- SHOP_PERFORMANCE view (permission issues with SHOP table)
- BUSINESS_DASHBOARD view (permission issues with INVENTORY table)

### 3. Implement Materialized Views
For optimal performance and cost savings, implement materialized views:
```sql
-- Example for Daily Sales Summary
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE MERCURIOS_DATA.ANALYTICS.DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY_TABLE AS
SELECT * FROM MERCURIOS_DATA.ANALYTICS.DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY;

-- Create refresh task
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK MERCURIOS_DATA.ADMIN.REFRESH_DAILY_SALES
WAREHOUSE = MERCURIOS_TASK_WH
SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 1 * * * America/Los_Angeles'
AS
TRUNCATE TABLE MERCURIOS_DATA.ANALYTICS.DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY_TABLE;
INSERT INTO MERCURIOS_DATA.ANALYTICS.DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY_TABLE
SELECT * FROM MERCURIOS_DATA.ANALYTICS.DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY;
```

### 4. Complete Resource Monitors
Set up resource monitors for each warehouse to control costs:
```sql
-- Create resource monitor for analytics warehouse
CREATE OR REPLACE RESOURCE MONITOR MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_MONITOR
WITH CREDIT_QUOTA = 10
FREQUENCY = DAILY
START_TIMESTAMP = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
TRIGGERS
  ON 75 PERCENT DO NOTIFY
  ON 90 PERCENT DO NOTIFY
  ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND;

-- Apply to warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_WH 
SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_MONITOR;
```

### 5. Implement Query Optimization
Optimize expensive queries:
```sql
-- Create clustering keys on frequently filtered columns
ALTER TABLE MERCURIOS_DATA.RAW.ORDERS CLUSTER BY (ORDER_DATE);
ALTER TABLE MERCURIOS_DATA.RAW.CUSTOMERS CLUSTER BY (CUSTOMER_ID);

-- Create search optimization on text columns frequently used in LIKE conditions
ALTER TABLE MERCURIOS_DATA.RAW.ARTICLES 
ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (NAME, DESCRIPTION);
```

### 6. Implement Auto-Suspension for All Warehouses
Ensure all warehouses auto-suspend when idle:
```sql
ALTER WAREHOUSE MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_WH 
SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 60;

ALTER WAREHOUSE MERCURIOS_DEV_WH 
SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 60;

ALTER WAREHOUSE MERCURIOS_LOADING_WH 
SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 60;
```

### 7. Implement Data Retention Policies
Set up data retention policies to manage storage costs:
```sql
-- Example for time travel retention
ALTER DATABASE MERCURIOS_DATA
SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 7;

-- Example for fail-safe retention (if needed)
ALTER DATABASE MERCURIOS_DATA
SET FAIL_SAFE_DAYS = 3;
```

## Cost Optimization Results

By implementing these steps, you can expect:

1. **Reduced Compute Costs**: Through proper warehouse sizing, auto-suspension, and resource monitors
2. **Optimized Storage Costs**: Through data retention policies and efficient schema design
3. **Improved Query Performance**: Through materialized views and clustering keys
4. **Better Cost Visibility**: Through the cost monitoring views and dashboards

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure ongoing ROI optimization:

1. Review the DAILY_COST_SUMMARY view weekly
2. Analyze query patterns using QUERY_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING
3. Adjust resource monitors as usage patterns change
4. Regularly review and optimize materialized view refresh schedules

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider implementing key-pair authentication for enhanced security
2. Evaluate multi-cluster warehouses for high-concurrency workloads
3. Implement row-level security for multi-tenant data access control
4. Consider Snowflake's resource optimization recommendations
