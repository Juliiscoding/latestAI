# Mercurios.ai Project Status and Roadmap

## Current Project Status

As of March 13, 2025, we have successfully completed the following key milestones:

### âœ… Completed Components

1. **Data Warehouse Infrastructure**
   - Snowflake account setup and configuration
   - Database and schema structure implementation
   - Warehouse sizing and configuration

2. **Cost Optimization Framework**
   - Resource monitors for all warehouses
   - Auto-suspension for idle compute resources
   - Cost monitoring views and alerts
   - Emergency cost reduction procedures

3. **Analytics Foundation**
   - Core analytics views for business insights
   - Optimized query patterns for cost efficiency
   - Permission structure for secure access

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

1. **Dashboard Infrastructure**
   - Materialized views for dashboard performance
   - Refresh tasks for data currency

2. **Fivetran Integration**
   - Basic connector setup
   - Initial data loading

## Next Steps to Go Live

To bring Mercurios.ai to production status, we recommend the following roadmap:

### Phase 1: Production Readiness (2-3 Weeks)

1. **Complete ETL Pipeline**
   - Finalize Fivetran connector configuration
   - Implement data validation and quality checks
   - Set up incremental loading patterns

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement key-pair authentication for service accounts
   - Complete row-level security implementation
   - Conduct security audit and penetration testing

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add clustering keys to frequently queried tables
   - Implement materialized views for common query patterns
   - Optimize warehouse sizing based on workload patterns

### Phase 2: Initial Deployment (2 Weeks)

1. **Tenant Onboarding**
   - Develop tenant provisioning workflow
   - Create tenant configuration templates
   - Implement tenant isolation testing

2. **User Access Management**
   - Set up user roles and permissions
   - Create user onboarding documentation
   - Implement single sign-on (SSO) if required

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up operational dashboards
   - Configure alert thresholds and notification channels
   - Implement automated health checks

### Phase 3: Go-Live and Scale (Ongoing)

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Conduct final pre-launch checklist
   - Perform staged rollout to initial customers
   - Monitor system performance and costs

2. **Customer Success**
   - Develop customer onboarding materials
   - Create dashboard templates for common use cases
   - Establish support processes and documentation

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Implement feedback collection mechanisms
   - Prioritize feature enhancements based on usage patterns
   - Optimize cost structure based on actual usage

## Resource Requirements

To complete the roadmap to production, we recommend:

1. **Development Resources**
   - 1 Snowflake Data Engineer (full-time)
   - 1 ETL/Integration Specialist (part-time)
   - 1 Dashboard/Visualization Developer (part-time)

2. **Infrastructure Budget**
   - Snowflake credits: ~500-1000 per month initially
   - Fivetran connectors: Based on volume pricing
   - AWS services (Lambda, S3, etc.): ~$300-500 per month

3. **Timeline**
   - Production readiness: 2-3 weeks
   - Initial deployment: 2 weeks
   - Full production capability: 4-6 weeks from today

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Cost Management**
   - Continue to leverage the cost optimization framework
   - Regular review of warehouse usage patterns
   - Implement additional resource monitors as needed

2. **Data Quality**
   - Implement comprehensive data validation
   - Establish data quality SLAs
   - Create automated testing for ETL processes

3. **Performance**
   - Monitor query performance and optimize as needed
   - Implement caching strategies for frequent queries
   - Balance performance with cost considerations

## Conclusion

The Mercurios.ai project has established a solid foundation with the Snowflake infrastructure and cost optimization framework. We are now positioned at the end of the infrastructure setup phase and ready to move into production readiness. With focused effort on the outlined roadmap, we can achieve a production-ready system within 4-6 weeks.
