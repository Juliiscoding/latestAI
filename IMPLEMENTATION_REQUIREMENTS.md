# Implementation Requirements for Earth Module

To implement the Earth module with real data from Snowflake, we need the following information and access:

## 1. Repository Access

- Access to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Juliiscoding/latestAI.git
- Branch permissions to create a new feature branch for Earth module development

## 2. Snowflake Connection Details

- Snowflake connection parameters for API integration:
  - Account: VRXDFZX-ZZ95717
  - Host: vrxdfzx-zz95717.snowflakecomputing.com
  - Database: MERCURIOS_DATA
  - Schema: ANALYTICS
  - Warehouse: MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_WH (for read-only queries)
  - Role: MERCURIOS_ANALYST (or a dedicated read-only role)

## 3. Authentication Requirements

- Current authentication method used in the Next.js application
- How tenant isolation is currently implemented
- Any existing role-based access control mechanisms

## 4. API Layer Information

- Details on any existing API gateway or middleware
- Current method for connecting to databases or external services
- Preferred approach for GraphQL implementation (Apollo, Relay, etc.)

## 5. Frontend Architecture Details

- Current Next.js version and configuration
- State management approach (Redux, Context API, etc.)
- UI component library in use
- Existing dashboard layout and navigation structure

## 6. Deployment Pipeline

- Current CI/CD setup for the Next.js application
- Environment variables management approach
- Staging environment details

## 7. Data Requirements

- Sample queries or expected output format for each analytics view:
  - DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY
  - CUSTOMER_INSIGHTS
  - PRODUCT_PERFORMANCE
  - INVENTORY_STATUS
  - SHOP_PERFORMANCE
  - BUSINESS_DASHBOARD

## 8. ML/LLM Integration

- Preferred approach for ML/LLM integration (API endpoints, direct integration, etc.)
- Any existing ML models or services already in use
- Requirements for recommendation engine outputs

## 9. Monitoring and Analytics

- Current monitoring tools in use
- Analytics tracking requirements
- Error reporting preferences

## Next Steps After Information Gathering

1. Clone the repository and analyze the current structure
2. Set up a secure connection to Snowflake from the Next.js application
3. Create the Earth module structure and initial components
4. Implement the GraphQL schema for data access
5. Develop the first dashboard with real Snowflake data
6. Add the recommendation engine integration
