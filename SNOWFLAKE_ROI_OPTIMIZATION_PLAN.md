# Snowflake ROI Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines how to maximize business value from Snowflake while minimizing costs. By optimizing Fivetran connectors, implementing efficient views, and scheduling reports strategically, we can reduce daily Snowflake costs from $48.94 to under $10 while still extracting valuable business insights.

## 1. Fivetran Connector Optimization

### High-Value Connectors
Based on our analysis, prioritize these data sources:
- **Shopify**: Contains critical sales and inventory data
- **Google Analytics**: Provides valuable customer behavior insights

### Recommended Sync Settings
| Connector | Current Frequency | Recommended Frequency | Justification |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Shopify | Continuous | Daily (1 AM) | Sales data is critical but doesn't need real-time updates |
| Google Analytics | Continuous | Daily (2 AM) | Website analytics are valuable but can be processed once daily |
| Klaviyo | Continuous | Weekly | Email marketing data changes less frequently |
| AWS Lambda | Continuous | Daily (12 AM) | Custom data integrations can be batched |

### Implementation Steps
1. Log into Fivetran
2. Navigate to the MERCURIOS destination
3. For each connector:
   - Click "Edit Schedule"
   - Change from "Continuous" to "Daily" or "Weekly"
   - Set appropriate times to avoid warehouse contention

## 2. Cost-Efficient Views & Materialization Strategy

### Pre-Aggregated Views
We've created these views to minimize query costs:
- `DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY`: Aggregates sales data by day, tenant, and category
- `INVENTORY_STATUS`: Provides current inventory levels and reorder alerts
- `CUSTOMER_INSIGHTS`: Summarizes customer behavior and lifetime value
- `PRODUCT_PERFORMANCE`: Tracks product sales and category rankings
- `BUSINESS_DASHBOARD`: Consolidates key metrics for executive reporting

### Materialization Strategy
For optimal performance and cost balance:
1. Keep views as views for infrequently accessed data
2. Convert to materialized views for frequently accessed data:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW MERCURIOS_DATA.ANALYTICS.DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY_MV
   AS SELECT * FROM MERCURIOS_DATA.ANALYTICS.DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY;
   ```
3. Schedule refreshes during off-hours:
   ```sql
   CREATE TASK refresh_sales_summary_mv
     WAREHOUSE = MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_WH
     SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 2 * * * Europe/Berlin'
   AS
     REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW MERCURIOS_DATA.ANALYTICS.DAILY_SALES_SUMMARY_MV;
   ```

## 3. Scheduled Dashboard & Reporting

### Daily Dashboard Refresh
1. Create a single scheduled task to refresh all dashboards at 3 AM:
   ```sql
   CREATE TASK dashboard_refresh_master
     WAREHOUSE = MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_WH
     SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 3 * * * Europe/Berlin'
   AS
     CALL MERCURIOS_DATA.ADMIN.REFRESH_ALL_DASHBOARDS();
   ```

2. Export results to S3 for consumption by visualization tools:
   ```sql
   COPY INTO @mercurios_exports/daily_dashboard/
   FROM MERCURIOS_DATA.ANALYTICS.BUSINESS_DASHBOARD
   FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' COMPRESSION = 'GZIP');
   ```

### Email Reports
Schedule automated email reports using Snowflake tasks:
```sql
CREATE TASK send_daily_summary_email
  WAREHOUSE = MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_WH
  SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 7 * * 1-5 Europe/Berlin'
AS
  CALL MERCURIOS_DATA.ADMIN.SEND_DAILY_SUMMARY_EMAIL();
```

## 4. Warehouse Optimization

### Warehouse Sizing Strategy
| Warehouse | Current Size | Optimized Size | Usage Pattern |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| MERCURIOS_LOADING_WH | XSMALL | XSMALL | Only active during ETL (1-3 AM) |
| MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_WH | XSMALL | SMALL (only during business hours) | Sized up during 9 AM - 5 PM |
| MERCURIOS_DEV_WH | XSMALL | XSMALL | Development use only |

### Auto-Scaling Configuration
```sql
-- Create a task to resize warehouses during business hours
CREATE TASK resize_for_business_hours
  WAREHOUSE = MERCURIOS_DEV_WH
  SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 9 * * 1-5 Europe/Berlin'
AS
  ALTER WAREHOUSE MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_WH SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL';

-- Create a task to downsize after hours
CREATE TASK downsize_after_hours
  WAREHOUSE = MERCURIOS_DEV_WH
  SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 18 * * 1-5 Europe/Berlin'
AS
  ALTER WAREHOUSE MERCURIOS_ANALYTICS_WH SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL';
```

## 5. Cost Monitoring & Governance

### Credit Alerts
Configure resource monitors with these thresholds:
- 80% of daily quota: Email notification
- 90% of daily quota: Email notification
- 100% of daily quota: Suspend warehouses

### Usage Tracking
Create a dashboard to track usage by tenant and feature:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW MERCURIOS_DATA.ADMIN.COST_MONITORING AS
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('DAY', START_TIME) AS DATE,
  WAREHOUSE_NAME,
  COUNT(*) AS QUERY_COUNT,
  SUM(TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME)/1000/60 AS RUNTIME_MINUTES,
  SUM(TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME)/1000/60/60 * 
    CASE 
      WHEN WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL' THEN 1
      WHEN WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL' THEN 2
      WHEN WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM' THEN 4
      WHEN WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE' THEN 8
      WHEN WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XLARGE' THEN 16
      ELSE 32
    END AS ESTIMATED_CREDITS
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE START_TIME >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, CURRENT_DATE())
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC, 5 DESC;
```

## 7. Expected Outcomes

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Daily Snowflake Cost | $48.94 | < $10.00 | > 80% reduction |
| Warehouse Uptime | 24/7 | 8 hours/day | 66% reduction |
| Query Performance | Variable | Consistent | Improved user experience |
| Business Insights | Ad-hoc | Scheduled | More reliable decision-making |

By implementing this plan, we'll transform Snowflake from a cost center into a strategic asset that delivers consistent business value at a predictable, manageable cost.
