# Fivetran-Snowflake Integration: Setup Summary

## Overview
We successfully configured the Fivetran connector for Snowflake using key-pair authentication. This document summarizes the steps taken, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Key Pair Authentication Setup
- Generated RSA key pair for secure authentication
- Assigned public key to FIVETRAN_USER in Snowflake
- Configured private key in Fivetran in the correct format

### 2. Snowflake User Configuration
- Set default warehouse for FIVETRAN_USER
- Granted necessary permissions to FIVETRAN_USER via MERCURIOS_FIVETRAN_SERVICE role
- Verified all permissions were correctly applied

### 3. Fivetran Connector Configuration
- Configured Fivetran destination with Snowflake connection details
- Set up fivetran_metadata connector
- Successfully passed all connection tests

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Private Key Format
**Challenge**: Fivetran requires the private key in a specific format with no line breaks.
**Solution**: Created a single-line version of the private key that Fivetran could accept.

### 2. Default Warehouse
**Challenge**: Fivetran required a default warehouse to be set for FIVETRAN_USER.
**Solution**: Created and executed a script to set MERCURIOS_LOADING_WH as the default warehouse.

### 3. Database Permissions
**Challenge**: FIVETRAN_USER lacked sufficient permissions to operate on the MERCURIOS_DATA database.
**Solution**: Created and executed a script to grant comprehensive permissions to the FIVETRAN_USER via the MERCURIOS_FIVETRAN_SERVICE role.

## Scripts Created
1. `assign_key_to_fivetran.py` - Assigns the public key to FIVETRAN_USER
2. `set_fivetran_default_warehouse.py` - Sets the default warehouse for FIVETRAN_USER
3. `grant_fivetran_permissions.py` - Grants necessary permissions to FIVETRAN_USER

## Next Steps
1. Start the initial sync to begin loading data
2. Monitor the sync process for any issues
3. Configure additional connectors as needed
4. Set up scheduled syncs for regular data updates

## Fivetran Quickstart Data Model

To enhance our monitoring capabilities, we've implemented the Fivetran Quickstart Data Model for metadata. This pre-built transformation package provides 19 analytics-ready views that help us monitor our Fivetran connectors, track sync performance, and identify issues.

### Key Benefits

1. **Immediate Visibility**: Get instant insights into connector health and performance without writing custom code
2. **Standardized Monitoring**: Use consistent metrics across all connectors and tenants
3. **Proactive Issue Detection**: Identify and resolve issues before they impact data availability
4. **Multi-Tenant Oversight**: Monitor data pipelines across all tenants from a central location

### Available Views

The Quickstart Data Model creates the following key views in the `FIVETRAN_LOG` schema:

#### Connector Monitoring
- `CONNECTOR_STATUS`: Current status of all connectors
- `DAILY_API_CALLS`: API usage by connector
- `SCHEMA_CHANGES`: History of schema changes

#### Error Tracking
- `ERROR_REPORTING`: Detailed error logs
- `CONNECTOR_ISSUES`: Summary of connector issues

#### Performance Metrics
- `SYNC_PERFORMANCE`: Sync duration and row counts
- `MONTHLY_ACTIVE_ROWS`: MAR usage by connector

### Implementation Process

1. Initial sync of the metadata connector to create the `FIVETRAN_METADATA` schema
2. Addition of the Quickstart Data Model through the Fivetran UI
3. Deployment of 19 transformation models to create the `FIVETRAN_LOG` schema
4. Verification of the deployment using our custom monitoring scripts

### Usage Examples

```sql
-- Monitor connector health
SELECT 
    connector_name,
    destination_name,
    connector_type,
    status,
    last_successful_sync,
    DATEDIFF('hour', last_successful_sync, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) as hours_since_last_sync
FROM MERCURIOS_DATA.FIVETRAN_LOG.CONNECTOR_STATUS
ORDER BY hours_since_last_sync DESC;

-- Track sync performance
SELECT 
    connector_name,
    AVG(sync_duration_mins) as avg_duration_mins,
    MAX(sync_duration_mins) as max_duration_mins,
    COUNT(*) as sync_count
FROM MERCURIOS_DATA.FIVETRAN_LOG.SYNC_PERFORMANCE
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY avg_duration_mins DESC;

-- Monitor errors
SELECT 
    connector_name,
    error_message,
    COUNT(*) as error_count
FROM MERCURIOS_DATA.FIVETRAN_LOG.ERROR_REPORTING
WHERE created_at >= DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY error_count DESC;
```

## Conclusion
The Fivetran-Snowflake integration is now successfully configured with key-pair authentication. This secure connection will allow for efficient data transfer from various sources into the Snowflake data warehouse, supporting the Mercurios.ai Predictive Inventory Management system.
