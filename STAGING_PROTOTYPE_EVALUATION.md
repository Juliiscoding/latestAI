# Staging Prototype Evaluation

## Assessment of Proposed Approach

The proposed approach for developing a staging prototype for Mercurios.ai's dashboard and recommendation engine aligns perfectly with the current stage of the project. This evaluation examines how the proposal fits within our architectural framework and roadmap.

## Alignment with Current Architecture

| Component | Current Status | Prototype Alignment | Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Data Foundation** | ‚úÖ Complete | Will leverage existing analytics views | Excellent fit |
| **Cost Optimization** | ‚úÖ Complete | Uses optimized warehouses | Well-aligned |
| **Security Framework** | üîÑ Partial | Implements basic auth & tenant routing | Good starting point |
| **ETL Pipeline** | üîÑ In Progress | Connects via GraphQL API | Appropriate abstraction |
| **Visualization Layer** | ‚ùå Not Started | Next.js dashboard implementation | Perfect timing |
| **AI Integration** | ‚ùå Not Started | Basic ML/LLM recommendations | Strategic addition |

## Strategic Benefits

1. **Accelerated Value Demonstration**
   - The prototype will showcase the business value of our analytics platform
   - Provides tangible examples of AI-driven insights for stakeholders
   - Creates a feedback loop for refining analytics views and data models

2. **Parallel Development Track**
   - Allows frontend/UX development to proceed in parallel with backend optimization
   - Validates GraphQL API design before full production implementation
   - Tests multi-tenant architecture in a controlled environment

3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Staging environment isolates experimentation from production data
   - Early identification of performance bottlenecks or data quality issues
   - Opportunity to refine security and access controls incrementally

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Stack Recommendations

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Recharts or D3.js for custom visualizations
- **API Layer**: Apollo GraphQL client connecting to our GraphQL API
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT for tenant-aware authentication
- **Deployment**: Vercel for staging with environment variable isolation

### Data Access Strategy

- Create a dedicated read-only Snowflake role for the staging prototype
- Implement query caching to minimize warehouse usage
- Consider materialized views for frequently accessed dashboard metrics
- Monitor query performance and costs during prototype testing

### AI/ML Integration Approach

- Start with simple, high-value forecasting models (e.g., inventory optimization)
- Use a modular approach that allows for progressive enhancement
- Document assumptions and limitations of initial ML implementations
- Prepare for A/B testing of recommendation effectiveness

## Roadmap Integration

The staging prototype fits well as a parallel workstream within our existing roadmap:

```
Current Phase: Foundation ‚Üí Production Readiness
                                    ‚Üì
                          [STAGING PROTOTYPE]
                                    ‚Üì
Next Phase: Initial Deployment with validated UI/UX
```

## Recommendation

**The proposed staging prototype approach is highly recommended** as it:

1. Builds upon our completed foundation work
2. Accelerates the path to demonstrating business value
3. Provides early validation of key architectural decisions
4. Creates a tangible product for stakeholder feedback
5. Aligns with our transition to production readiness

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype Scoping**
   - Define specific metrics and visualizations for the initial dashboard
   - Identify 2-3 high-value recommendation use cases to implement
   - Document API requirements and data access patterns

2. **Development Setup**
   - Create a dedicated staging environment in Snowflake
   - Set up the Next.js project with required dependencies
   - Establish CI/CD pipeline for the prototype

3. **Implementation Sprint**
   - Develop core dashboard components and data fetching
   - Implement basic recommendation engine integration
   - Create tenant isolation and authentication framework

4. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - Define success metrics for the prototype
   - Establish performance benchmarks
   - Create a feedback collection mechanism for stakeholders

The staging prototype represents an excellent bridge between our foundation work and full production deployment, providing tangible value while we complete the remaining infrastructure optimizations.
