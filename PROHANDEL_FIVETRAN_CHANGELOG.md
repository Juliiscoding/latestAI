# ProHandel API Integration Changelog

## Overview
This changelog documents the development and troubleshooting of the AWS Lambda function for integrating the ProHandel API with Fivetran for the Mercurios.ai Predictive Inventory Management project.

## Latest Status (2025-03-08)
- Lambda function has been successfully implemented with proper schema generation and data enhancement
- The function correctly handles Fivetran's test, schema, and sync operations
- Snowflake check revealed that data has not yet been loaded into Snowflake through Fivetran
- Next steps include verifying Fivetran connector configuration and triggering a sync

## Key Components

### Lambda Function Implementation
- Located at `/Users/juliusrechenbach/API ProHandelTest/lambda_connector/lambda_function.py`
- Handles Fivetran's test, schema, and sync operations
- Uses predefined JSON schemas from the `validators/schemas` directory
- Implements fallback logic to infer schemas from sample data
- Authenticates with ProHandel API and refreshes tokens as needed
- Enhances data with calculated fields using the `DataEnhancer` class

### Data Enhancement
- Located at `/Users/juliusrechenbach/API ProHandelTest/lambda_connector/data_enhancer.py`
- Adds calculated fields like profit margins and price tiers
- Creates full addresses from component fields
- Adds age calculations for orders and sales
- Categorizes inventory stock levels

### Data Aggregation
- Located at `/Users/juliusrechenbach/API ProHandelTest/lambda_connector/data_aggregator.py`
- Provides daily sales aggregations (counts, quantities, amounts)
- Generates article sales aggregations (sales by product)
- Creates warehouse inventory aggregations (stock by location)

## Detailed Changelog

### 2025-03-08: Lambda Function Testing and Snowflake Verification
- Fixed missing `timezone` import in `lambda_function.py`
- Successfully tested schema generation functionality
- Verified that the Lambda function correctly enhances data
- Created and ran `check_snowflake_data_new.py` to check for ProHandel data in Snowflake
- Found that no ProHandel data has been loaded into Snowflake yet
- Identified that Fivetran connector may not be fully configured or hasn't completed its first sync

### 2025-03-07: Lambda Function Enhancements
- Enhanced the `handle_schema` function to load predefined JSON schemas
- Improved primary key detection and type mapping for Fivetran compatibility
- Updated the `handle_sync` function to ensure proper authentication
- Added comprehensive error handling for each entity type
- Enhanced data with calculated fields using the `DataEnhancer` class
- Updated state management to use current timestamps for bookmarks

### 2025-03-06: Initial Lambda Function Setup
- Created basic AWS Lambda function structure
- Implemented authentication with ProHandel API
- Set up initial schema generation logic
- Configured basic data synchronization functionality
- Added environment variables for API credentials

## Known Issues and Limitations
1. The Lambda function has a timeout of 3 minutes, which may be insufficient for large data volumes
2. Some entity types (like "shop") don't have predefined schemas and rely on schema inference
3. The data enhancement process may need optimization for performance with large datasets
4. Fivetran connector configuration needs verification to ensure proper data flow to Snowflake

## Next Steps
1. Verify Fivetran connector configuration in the Fivetran console
2. Ensure the Lambda function is properly deployed to AWS with correct permissions
3. Manually trigger a sync in Fivetran to test the connection
4. Check CloudWatch logs for the Lambda function to verify Fivetran calls
5. Monitor the data flow into Snowflake and validate data quality

## Environment Configuration
- AWS Lambda function with 256MB memory and 3-minute timeout
- Fivetran connector configured in "Columns" sync mode
- Snowflake database: MERCURIOS_DATA
- Target schemas: FIVETRAN_ARMED_UNLEADED_STAGING, FIVETRAN_ARMED_UNLEADED
